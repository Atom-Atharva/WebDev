        <hr />
        <p>I like many things to do, but my most favourites are as given below:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <h2>Photo Manipulation</h2>
                <p>Photograph manipulation involves the transformation or alteration of a
                    photograph. Some photograph manipulations are considered to be skillful artwork, while others are
                    considered to be unethical practices, especially when used to deceive.

            <li>
                <h2>Brain Storming</h2>
                <p>Brainstorming is a group creativity technique by which efforts are made to find
                    a conclusion for a specific problem by gathering a list of ideas spontaneously contributed by its
                    members.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h2>Watching Movies</h2>
                <p>Watching movies can have a positive emotional impact. Movies can calm us down
                    and soothe us. We reduce the stress within us by lowering worry, and even watching a movie may turn
                    all
                    negative thoughts into the better, as long as it is enjoyable
                </p>

            <li>
                <h2>Games</h2>
                <p>It allows them to experiment through trial and error, find solutions to problems, work
                    out the best strategies, and build new confidence and skills
                </p>
